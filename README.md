# Machine-Learning-From-Scratch
Building machine learning algorithms from the ground up in Python.

This will be an ongoing project and I aim to cover the following:

- Linear Regression ✅
- Logistic Regression ✅
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Decision Trees
- Naive Bayes
- K-Means
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Neural Network
